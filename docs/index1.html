	<h3 align="middle">Turbo Blast is a third person racing game. Have a blast navigating through sharp turns and narrow roads as you compete against your friends. Purchase items like nails and broken tires to give your oppenents a hard time. If you don't have friends, don't worry: play against the CPU.</h3>
	
	<br />
	<p>Problem: We are trying to solve multiple gaming problems. These include applying realistic acceleration and decceleration, calculating turning centripetal forces and turning radius, and collision detection with complex shapes. We will apply the laws of motion and kinematic physics to solve these problems. We will probably use estimations of these laws as to conserve computing power.</p>
	<br />
	
	<p>
		Goals: The main goal is to complete a well made game that is free of bugs and make it fun for users to play with. To do this we must accomplish multiple things:
			<ul>
				<li>Implement the physics correctly (see problem above)</li>
				<li>Provide good perfomance and enforce FPS consistency, perhaps with the support of GPU</li>
				<li>Make aesthetically pleasing models of the cars and map</li>
			</ul>
		Finally, the completed project will include an intuitive interface and also at least one playable racing track and multiple cars. There will be either a local multiplayer system or an AI system implemented so the user can compete against something.
	</p> 
	
	<p>
		To measure quality, we will simply demo the game to people. If they are having fun, then it is of good quality.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Possible goals: Because of the lack of time to deployment, it is possible we do not meet these requirements. This is okay though, as they are rather complex to implement.
			<ul>
				<li>Provide graphical improvements such as anti-aliasing and motion blur</li>
				<li>Provide multiple racing tracks and implement a currency or unlocking system (not DLC thats lame) to incentivize good players</li>
				<li>Provide online muliplayer</li>
				<li>Provide GPU support and real-time ray-tracing using the RTX architecture</li>
				<li>Other improvements that have not been considered during the planning phase</li>
			</ul>
	</p>
		
	<h3>Now we will discuss our timeline</h3>
	
	<p>
		Week 1: We will spend this week learning how to use the LibGDX framework to create a third person game. We will probably make a simple 3D game as practice from a tutorial.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Week 2: Develop the assets. Learn how to create the map, the cars, the obstacles, and the scenery (grass, flowers, trees). Perhaps compose some epic music and sound effects to complement the exciting race.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Week 3: Develop the game now. Combining our knowledge from the first week and the assets we built during the second week, produce the racing game using the LibGDX framework.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Week 4: Continue developing the game. As we finish, begin to severely test for bugs and fix performance blocks.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Resources:</h3>
	
	<p>
		Luckily for us, there are many different ways to learn LibGDX. Here are some we found from a quick literature search:
		<ul>
			<li>Game from scratch tutorial: https://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/LibGDX-Tutorial-series.aspx</li>
			<li>Tutorial from the LibGDX source Github page: https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/A-simple-game</li>
			<li>Flappy bird tutorial: http://www.kilobolt.com/zombie-bird-tutorial-flappy-bird-remake.html</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		To learn how to make 3D models and music:
		<ul>
			<li>3D game modeling for beginners: https://www.gamedesigning.org/learn/3d-modeling/</li>
			<li>Blender tutorials: https://www.blender.org/support/tutorials/</li>
			<li>How to make game music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMKLwmfYjH4 </li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Some of these tutorials will be unnessessary for some members as they know how to use LibGDX, make models, or compose music.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Since this is a video game, we will be drawing inspiration from other games including Mario Kart, Star Fox, and Wipeout.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Now we will include a <a href="trees.html">tree</a> of GameObjects and their attributes. This will be updated as we realize more complexities of the game.</h3>
	<h3>Two week update: <a href="deliv1.html">Deliverable 1</a> </h3>

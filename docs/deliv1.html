	<p>Problem: We are trying to solve multiple gaming problems. These include applying realistic acceleration and decceleration, calculating turning centripetal forces and turning radius, and collision detection with complex shapes. We will apply the laws of motion and kinematic physics to solve these problems. We will probably use estimations of these laws as to conserve computing power.</p>
    <p>Progress so far: In line with our tentative timeline, we have learned the basics of LibGDX and have imported starter code for our game. Additionally, we have also 
        created many classes to deal with the physics that our world is subject to, from basic forces like gravity and acceleration to more advanced concepts like collision detection.
        We have also begun to create the track with heightmaps that will be turned into meshes that we will hopefully map textures onto to create a fully formed track. We have yet to create many
        models for the environment and the cars themselves, but this will come in the following week. 
    </p>

    <p>Preliminary Results & tentative timeline: So far, we have created a general world that our game will live in, and have yet to create the specific 3D models that will populate our game. In the next couple
        of weeks, the goal for this week is to create the 3D models for cars, trees, and other objects in the world. And next week, it is to integrate them into the world and try and perfect the user controls for the game. </p>

	<p>
		Updated Goals: The main goal is to complete a well made game that is free of bugs and make it fun for users to play with. To do this we must accomplish multiple things:
			<ul>
                <li>Create the 3D models for cars that will populate the game</li>
                <li>Integrate these models seemlessly with the game physics</li>
				<li>Provide good perfomance and enforce FPS consistency, perhaps with the support of GPU</li>
			</ul>

	<h3>Preliminary Timeline</h3>
	
	<p>
		Week 1: We will spend this week learning how to use the LibGDX framework to create a third person game. We will probably make a simple 3D game as practice from a tutorial.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Week 2: Develop the assets. Learn how to create the map, the cars, the obstacles, and the scenery (grass, flowers, trees). Perhaps compose some epic music and sound effects to complement the exciting race.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Week 3: Develop the game now. Combining our knowledge from the first week and the assets we built during the second week, produce the racing game using the LibGDX framework.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Week 4: Continue developing the game. As we finish, begin to severely test for bugs and fix performance blocks.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Updated Timeline</h3>
	
	<p>
		Completed Week 1: We will spend this week learning how to use the LibGDX framework to create a third person game. Created the world that the game resides in, and added simple physical constants like gravity. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Completed Week 2: Added more advanced physical concepts and collision detection, as well as created the mesh for the racetrack. Also composed the music to accompany the game.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Tentative Week 3: Develop 3D models on blender to be subject to our world: mainly cars and landscape elements like trees
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Tentative Week 4: Integrate these models into the LibGDX project and perfect user controls of the cars, add more game functions like placement and lap times. If time permits, add anti-aliasing and other optimizations.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p> We met a good amount of our goals in the first two weeks, and though we did not build many of the assets yet, we have exchanged that goal with creating a solid world for the game that will act as a solid foundation which
            we can then integrate our 3D models into.
